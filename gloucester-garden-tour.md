At the dawn of the twentieth century, Magnolia was well known as a vacation destination with a casino and grand hotels. Exclusive stores like Tiffany's and magnificent mansions lined Lexington Avenue and Shore Road. Join us on a walk down memory lane for the Fifth Generous Gardener's Garden Tour in the quiet seaside village of Magnolia. Stroll along Shore Road viewing over a dozen private gardens, many with glorious ocean views. This tour showcases a variety of cottage gardens, rose gardens, estate gardens and also includes an amazing Olmsted garden. It is predominantly a walking tour (1.6 miles) with a few gardens a short shuttle bus ride from downtown Magnolia.

Tickets are $30 per person. Tickets may be purchased in advance here, or on the day of the tour. On the day of the tour, pick up your ticket/booklet with maps and descriptions at the Magnolia Library, 1 Lexington Avenue, Gloucester, MA 01930.

Please no pets. Rain or Shine.
