Generous Gardeners is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization founded by Susan Kelly and Terese O'Connell. The original idea was to be a plant donation/swapping website, but it has evolved into a group of volunteer gardeners with the mission of philanthropy through gardening. We currently care for 22 public spaces in Gloucester, MA. Most of our plants are donated by our volunteers, but we also purchase plants with funds from the annual Gloucester Garden tour. Visit www.GloucesterGardenTour.org for tickets and information.

All volunteers are welcome. Email susan@generousgardeners.org to be added to our notification email list for where we are working next.

**Police Station:**

We started with the embankment behind the police station on Roger's Street which had been a hazardous eyesore for over a decade. Now it is rivers of flowers including many blue flowers as requested by the police.

**Traffic Islands:**

Many traffic Islands in Gloucester had become neglected barren places. We have planted thousands of bulbs and drought tolerant plants although we also regularly lug water to keep things alive in those hard locations.

**Sargent House Museum**

One of the early gardens planted by Generous Gardens was the Sargent House Museum which is now a lovely spot enjoyed by many on our busy Main Street.

**Stacy Boulevard Gardens**

Our major new responsibility are the new beds surrounding the fishermen's wives memorial. As part of the seawall reconstruction project, Generous Gardeners was approached by the DPW and asked to assist in planning, planting and maintenance of this beautiful new addition to Gloucester. The beds were installed in the fall of 2016 and we immediately planted 22,400 tulips. In Spring of 2017 we will be planting over 13,000 additional flowers for a permanent beautiful addition to the Gloucester Harbor Stacy Boulevard.
