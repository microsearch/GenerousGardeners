description: Generous Gardeners is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization founded by Susan
  Kelly and Terese Oâ€™Connell.  The original idea was to be a plant donation/swapping
  website, but it has evolved into a group of volunteer gardeners with the mission
  of philanthropy through gardening.  We currently care for 22 public spaces in Gloucester,
  MA.
